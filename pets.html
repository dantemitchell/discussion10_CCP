            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <h2>Fitz</h2>
            <img src="images/Fitz.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown and White Boston terrier">

            <p>Fitz is a Boston terrier with lots of energy. He loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.</p> 
            <p>He also loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack. </p>

            <p>Petey is a 9 year old mut. He was a rescue dog so we were never able to find out what breed he is. However, he looks a lot like an Anatolian Shepard. He is a very gentle and cute dog to those that he loves, but a mean guard dog to mailmen and delivery men.</p>
